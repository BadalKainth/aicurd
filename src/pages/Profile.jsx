//               None can ignore the genuine desireof the Government to uplift the
//               SC/ST people and the role played by its efforts in changing the
//               mode of thinking and attitudes of these two segments of the
//               population. Thus, the educational policies of the Government,
//               provision of reservation in jobs, policies in the fields of
//               agriculture, cooperation, communication, industrialization, social
//               services, etc. have brought the members of the Scheduled Caste and
//               Scheduled Tribe communities closer to the main stream of national
//               life. Tribal markets have been linked up with urban markets
//               providing greater economic opportunities to the tribals and SCs
//               creating a commercial attitude in them, as a result, the concept
//               of saving is gaining acceptance, and there is a definite shift in
//               the consumption pattern of these two communities from need based
//               to consumer durable goods. Yet, all said and done, the efforts so
//               far have not helped in solving, in any significant measure, the
//               problems of poverty, malnutrition and exploitation faced by the
//               tribal as well as the Scheduled Castes.
//             </p>
//             <p>
//               Keeping all these considerations in view, the Government of India
//               initiated special schemes for the development of the areas
//               inhabited by these two communities to supplement the benefits
//               accruing from general programmes of development in different
//               fields. These can be grouped broadly under four heads (a)
//               communication s (b) education and culture (c) development of
//               tribal economy and (d) health, housing and water supply.

//               AICURD was awarded the task of conducting mid-term survey to
//               assess the impact of those schemes on these two communities in

//             </h3>
//             <p>
//               It is well known that HIV/AIDS epidemic represented the most
//               serious public health problem in India. It is estimated that more
//               than 5 million Indians are infected with the virus. The prevalence
//               of infection in all parts of the country highlights the spread
//               from urban to rural areas and from high risk to general
//               population. Delhi being an immigrating capital state faces
//               tremendous vulnerability. Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS)
//               has been implementing NationalAIDS control program since 1992. In
//               the recent times, DSACS has implemented National AIDS Control
//               program–Phase III (NACP-III) under a five-year project
//               implementation plan (2005-2009). Targeted Intervention is one of
//               the core strategies for preventionof HIV in India under NACP-III.
//             </p>
//             <p>
//               The basic purpose of targeted Intervention program is to reduce
//               the rate of transmission among the most vulnerable and
//               marginalized sections of population such as commercial sex workers
//               (CSWs), men having sex with men (MSMs), truckers, street children,
//               migrant labor, intravenous drug users (IDUs) etc., who are highly
//               vulnerable to the transmission of HIV by virtue of their high risk
//               behavior and socio-economic conditions. This program was
//               implemented by DSACS through NGOs. AICURD being one such partner
//               NGO was entrusted with the implementation of targeted Intervention
//               program among migrant labourers. The project was last sanctioned
//               by DSACS in June 2008. The area selected for implementation of the
//               programme is Samaipur Badli in northwest Delhi.
//             </p>
//             <p>
//               A preliminary survey of Samaipur-Badli indicated that it was
//               8|Page a typical example of uncontrolled urbanization. The
//               population of Samaipur-Badli predominantly consists of laborers
//               who have migrated to Delhi in search of employment from other
//               states. The area is characterized by garbage; filth, smoke and
//               filthy water in open drains and stagnant pools that overwhelm
//               anyone visiting the area. These conditions have ultimately led to
//               a serious health hazard for the people. The programwas launched in
//               six clusters of Samaipur-Badli. In the initial stage the people in
//               the target area did not show much enthusiasm in the program on
//               control of HIV/AIDS. In fact, like most other communities, the
//               people considered the visits of AICURD functionaries as an
//               unwanted intrusion. Later with the repeated and persistent efforts
//               of AICURD through counseling, group discussions etc. the
//               community, by and large, accepted AICURD’s agenda on HIV/AIDS and
//               started extending cooperation in their endeavors.

//               The areas were in and around northwest Delhi covering five major
//               clusters of the region. It may be indicated that the areas for TB

//               large percentage of HIV+ patients are prone to suffer from TB
//               infection due to breakdown in the overall immunity system of their
//               physiology. DOT providers were trained service providers in terms
//               of TB anti bacterial medicines. DOT centers were usually in the
//               midst of the community so that it could be easier for the poor and
//               malnourished people to conveniently come for their treatment. A

      "None can ignore the genuine desire of the Government to uplift the SC/ST people and the role played by its efforts in changing the mode of thinking and attitudes of these two segments of the population. Thus, the educational policies of the Government, provision of reservation in jobs, policies in the fields of agriculture, cooperation, communication, industrialization, social services, etc. have brought the members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities closer to the main stream of national life. Tribal markets have been linked up with urban markets providing greater economic opportunities to the tribals and SCs creating a commercial attitude in them, as a result, the concept of saving is gaining acceptance, and there is a definite shift in the consumption pattern of these two communities from need based to consumer durable goods. Yet, all said and done, the efforts so far have not helped in solving, in any significant measure, the problems of poverty, malnutrition and exploitation faced by the tribal as well as the Scheduled Castes.",

It fuels imagination, puts life into fiction and original stories. It helps us connect better, think with more empathy, reach out where we are needed. It makes us conscious of what’s happening around us, think of society as a whole and move on from ‘me’ to ‘we’. It is not associated with any political thought but the importance of necessary and productive ‘thinking’ is a driving force and the need to trigger productive ‘thought’ wherever required and possible is one of our constant endeavours.",

For quite sometime, AICURD had been reflecting on the need for taking up a suitable plan of work in order to involve itself wholeheartedly to play its role effectively in the national effort of combating the forces of secessionism and preserving and strengthening integration of the civil society of the country. Hence AICURD designed work plan for promoting secularism and national integration through social action by organizing and conducting national integration and communal harmony camps with the participation of young energetic and dynamic persons who could be the ‘Change Agents’ for confronting the disruptionist and divisive forces playing havoc with the nation's security and holding back the pace of socio-economic progress of the country.",

      "A comprehensive Project Proposal was therefore prepared for holding five camps of 10-days duration each, along with its mode of operation, curriculum and budget and provisions required by the Department of Youth Affairs and Sports of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development on the pattern of its scheme of support for activities on National Integration and Communal Harmony. The proposal was sanctioned and funds for organising the camps were released to AICURD. Accordingly five camps were held in Karnal, (Haryana), Ujjain (M.P), Hyderabad (A.P), Jammu and Kashmir and Sultanpur (U.P).",
