            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Socio-Economic Survey</h2>
            <p>
              None can ignore the genuine desireof the Government to uplift the
              SC/ST people and the role played by its efforts in changing the
              mode of thinking and attitudes of these two segments of the
              population. Thus, the educational policies of the Government,
              provision of reservation in jobs, policies in the fields of
              agriculture, cooperation, communication, industrialization, social
              services, etc. have brought the members of the Scheduled Caste and
              Scheduled Tribe communities closer to the main stream of national
              life. Tribal markets have been linked up with urban markets
              providing greater economic opportunities to the tribals and SCs
              creating a commercial attitude in them, as a result, the concept
              of saving is gaining acceptance, and there is a definite shift in
              the consumption pattern of these two communities from need based
              to consumer durable goods. Yet, all said and done, the efforts so
              far have not helped in solving, in any significant measure, the
              problems of poverty, malnutrition and exploitation faced by the
              tribal as well as the Scheduled Castes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keeping all these considerations in view, the Government of India
              initiated special schemes for the development of the areas
              inhabited by these two communities to supplement the benefits
              accruing from general programmes of development in different
              fields. These can be grouped broadly under four heads (a)
              communication s (b) education and culture (c) development of
              tribal economy and (d) health, housing and water supply.
            </p>
            <p>
              AICURD was awarded the task of conducting mid-term survey to
              assess the impact of those schemes on these two communities in
              relation to the following four districts spreading over three
              states, being sponsored by the Union Ministry of Welfare.

                Targeted Intervention for Prevention of HIV/AIDS
              </strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              It is well known that HIV/AIDS epidemic represented the most
              serious public health problem in India. It is estimated that more
              than 5 million Indians are infected with the virus. The prevalence
              of infection in all parts of the country highlights the spread
              from urban to rural areas and from high risk to general
              population. Delhi being an immigrating capital state faces
              tremendous vulnerability. Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS)
              has been implementing NationalAIDS control program since 1992. In
              the recent times, DSACS has implemented National AIDS Control
              program–Phase III (NACP-III) under a five-year project
              implementation plan (2005-2009). Targeted Intervention is one of
              the core strategies for preventionof HIV in India under NACP-III.
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic purpose of targeted Intervention program is to reduce
              the rate of transmission among the most vulnerable and
              marginalized sections of population such as commercial sex workers
              (CSWs), men having sex with men (MSMs), truckers, street children,
              migrant labor, intravenous drug users (IDUs) etc., who are highly
              vulnerable to the transmission of HIV by virtue of their high risk
              behavior and socio-economic conditions. This program was
              implemented by DSACS through NGOs. AICURD being one such partner
              NGO was entrusted with the implementation of targeted Intervention
              program among migrant labourers. The project was last sanctioned
              by DSACS in June 2008. The area selected for implementation of the
              programme is Samaipur Badli in northwest Delhi.
            </p>
            <p>
              A preliminary survey of Samaipur-Badli indicated that it was
              8|Page a typical example of uncontrolled urbanization. The
              population of Samaipur-Badli predominantly consists of laborers
              who have migrated to Delhi in search of employment from other
              states. The area is characterized by garbage; filth, smoke and
              filthy water in open drains and stagnant pools that overwhelm
              anyone visiting the area. These conditions have ultimately led to
              a serious health hazard for the people. The programwas launched in
              six clusters of Samaipur-Badli. In the initial stage the people in
              the target area did not show much enthusiasm in the program on
              control of HIV/AIDS. In fact, like most other communities, the
              people considered the visits of AICURD functionaries as an
              unwanted intrusion. Later with the repeated and persistent efforts
              of AICURD through counseling, group discussions etc. the
              community, by and large, accepted AICURD’s agenda on HIV/AIDS and
              started extending cooperation in their endeavors.

              </strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              AICURD was running five DOT centers in Samaipur Badli and
              Bhalasawa as part of Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP)
              of Govt. of India and the Govt. of NCT Delhi. Unde this program,
              five very poor clusters were identifiedwhich had tremendous
              vulnerability for TB and other related pulmonary infection.
            </p>
            <p>
              The areas were in and around northwest Delhi covering five major
              clusters of the region. It may be indicated that the areas for TB
              and HIV intervention were more or less similar simply because a
              large percentage of HIV+ patients are prone to suffer from TB
              infection due to breakdown in the overall immunity system of their
              physiology. DOT providers were trained service providers in terms
              of TB anti bacterial medicines. DOT centers were usually in the
              midst of the community so that it could be easier for the poor and
              malnourished people to conveniently come for their treatment. A
              large number of poor people were benefited in this service
              delivery of DOT. Qualitatively and quantitatively, AICURD had
              invested a concerted effort in ensuring a much-desired service for
              a needy section of society.

                Project on Participatory Waste Management in Bhalaswa, Delhi
                Under Yamuna Action Plan
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              The Yamuna, as on today is an ailing river. Yet it is sacred to
              all of us. The Yamuna is being polluted by raw sewage, fecal
              matter, industrial effluents, dumping of solid waste and open
              defecation, dumping of unburnt/half-burnt dead bodies and animal
              carcasses, dhobi ghats, cattle wallowing,bathing and religious
              offerings. It is for this reason that it had been considered
              necessary to make every citizen in Delhi and every visitor to the
              city to know as to how they pollute the Yamuna and how can they
              help in bringing it back to its natural state. With this
              realization ‘Public Participation and Public Awareness’ programme
              was included as one of the nine components in the Yamuna Action
              Plan (YAP). The YAP was funded by a loan from the Japan Bank of
              International Co-operation (JBIC) to the National River
              Conservation Directorate (NRCD), Government of India. The
              implementation of the YAP in Delhi had been assigned to the
              Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).
            </p>
            <p>
              The MCD entrusted the implementation of the above component of YAP
              to the Asian Centre for Organization Research and Development
              (ACORD). As the apex organization for implementation of the
              component, ACORD was to work with three partner NGOs namely the
              All India Centre for Urban and Rural Development (AICURD), the
              Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) and the Joint Assistance
              Centre (JAC). The duration of the project was one year.

              <p>
                It was expected that as a result of measures taken under Yamuna
                Action Plan, particularly People’s Participation and People’s
                Awareness, Delhi’s citizens would become more aware of the
                problem of pollution of Yamuna and the role they can play to
                save the river. It would bring about favorable changes in the
                practices prevalent among people; reduce pollution of Yamuna,
                and promote conservation of its waste. There would be increased
                and effective use of CTCs and these would be maintained better
                with the involvement of local communities. As a result, a
                sustainable and replicable model of participatory waste
                management would be developed.
